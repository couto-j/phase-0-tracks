# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows you to track changes made on a file. It also helps because it can coordinate work being accomplished by multiple people. For example, if I worked on a file, I can go ahead and save my changes, and those changes will be available for someone to pick up and work with in the future.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch allows you to work on a file and commit changes within the branch without effecting the master. If your changes do what you want them to do, you can merge the branch so it can be deployed. In essence, a branch creates a safe enviornment to work our your fixes or improvements but without impacting the overall project until you're sure the work you done does what you want it to do.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit saves the changes you've made to a file. It should outline why the change was necessary, how our fix address the issue, what effects your change has, and what it does.

* What is a merge conflict?

A mrege conflict is an error when attempting to merge one branch into another. It could happen because a colleague edited the same file on the same lines as you did, or because someone has deleted a file that you've modified, for example.


Change is here: I feel like a tech master learning all this stuff already. Can't wait for week 2!
