    <h1>Knit Your Heart Out!</h1>
    <p> Knitting is a <strong>wonderful</strong> hobby to learn because it has a calming effect <em>and</em> it's productive - you get to enjoy a finished project either for yourself or as a gift to someone special when you're done.</p>
    <h2>Knitting Supplies</h2>
    <p>Here are a few of the supplies you'll need to get started with your new hobby:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A beginner scarf knitting pattern, like <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/264106/basic-scarf-pattern"> this</a> one.</li>
        <li>Yarn that corresponds with your pattern - make sure to pick your favorite color!</li>
        <li>Knitting needles.</li>
        <li>Safety pin.</li>
        <li>Tape measure.</li>
        <li>Patience. <em>Patience.</em> <strong><em>Patience.</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Your Crafting Space</h2>
    <p>It's important to create a space where you can relax and enjoy the simple action of your hands repeating the same movements over and over again, creating stitch after stitch as you build your fabric.</p>
    <p>Feel free to pick a favorite chair or your favorite seat on the couch and cozy up with some pillows and a good light. Soft background music will work to set the mood, or you can even binge watch (read: <em>listen</em>) to your favorite television show.</p>
    <h2>The Knit Stitch</h2>
    <p>The majority of your first knitting project will simply be knitting every stitch, so we've written this handy how-to instructional guide that will take you through each step in chronological order.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hold the needle with the stitches in your left hand.</li>
        <li>Insert the point of the right needle into the first stitch from front to back.</li>
        <li>With your right index finger, wrap the working yarn around the right needle <em>counter-clockwise</em>.</li>
        <li>Pull the new loop on your right needle through the loop on the left needle.</li>
        <li>Slide the original loop off the left needle.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 through 5 until you've reached the end of your row. All the stitches should have been knit from your left needle to your right needle. Your left needle is now empty.</li>
        <li>Begin each new row following the instructions from step 1 through 6.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CONGRATULATIONS! You're a knitter!</h3>
